        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Orfeo Kaplow.
            <br>
            As a beginner game developer, I have always had a passion for creating interactive and fun experiences for others to enjoy, especially for my friends and me.
            At 16 years old, I have already shown a strong interest in computer science and am looking to further my education in this field. I am now 17 and almost done with school.
            <br>
            <br>
            My curiosity and drive to learn new things have served me well so far, and I am confident that they will continue to do so as I 
            continue on my journey as a game developer. Whether I am working on small personal project or doing something as a team on group projects, 
            my dedication and hard work have always been a driving force behind my games.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a bright future ahead of me, I am excited to see all that I will accomplish as a game developer and computer scientist. 
            I am confident that my skills and determination will lead me to great success in the industry, and I can't wait to see what the 
            future holds.
